# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity's computer vision nanodegree.

Using computer vision techniques and deep learning CNN architectures this project builds a facial keypoint detection system. These facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth of the human face.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

__Notebook 4__ : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses


### Data

[download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5aea1b91_train-test-data/train-test-data.zip)

After downloading the data extract them into a folder called `data`

This folder has training and tests dataset of image/keypoint data, and their respective csv files. This will be further explored in Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing Data
